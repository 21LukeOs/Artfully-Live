# Artfully Live

> Photography contest for photographers and fans of photography

This is a MERN stack application which allows users to both upload their photography, and vote on their favourite images.


### TODOS

This is a beta version. Decided updates will include a server-side cron job which will implement a 24 hour rotation for the contest, making it daily. This means clearing the gallery and saving the day's top 3. Also plan to include the previous days' winners displayed in the gallery, and possibly implement an end of the week contest for every day's top 3 for the week.

As previously stated, this is a beta. No user information is collected or stored other than the name, email and password entered when registering. Dummy credentials can be used to gain access as long as the email is in standard format and the password is at least 6 characters long.
