# Artfully Live

> Photography contest for photographers and fans of photography

This is a MERN stack application which allows users to both upload their photography, and vote on their favourite images.

### Desktop/Laptop version, mobile friendly coming very soon

### TODOS

This is a beta version. Decided updates will include a server-side cron job which will implement a 24 hour rotation for the contest, making it daily. This means clearing the gallery and saving the day's top 3. Also plan to include the previous days' winners displayed in the gallery, and possibly implement an end of the week contest for every day's top 3 for the week.

### Link to site

The live website/app will be here: http://artfully.live

As stated, this is a beta. SSL is not yet configured. No personal information other than the email and password entered when registering is stored. Dummy credentials can be used to gain access so long as the email given is in standard format, and the password is at least 6 characters long (obviously don't re-use any passwords used anywhere else).
